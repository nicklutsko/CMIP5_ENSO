# CMIP5_ENSO

This readme contains a description of the files deposited in this directory. These files were used to perform the analysis in the study "The Relationship Between Cloud Radiative Effect and Surface Temperature Variability at ENSO Frequencies in CMIP5 Models" submitted to GRL by Nick Lutsko in 2018.

Please note that the code in this directory comes without any warranty, without even the implied warranty of merchantibility or fitness for a particular purpose.

The directory contains three folders:

-The folder Bony_decomp contains the scripts used to bin the data by the \omega_500 velocities.
-The folder frequency_regr contains the scripts used to perform the frequency-dependent regressions.
-The folder analysis contains the scripts to make the figures.

The file "models_data.py" contains the model names and sensitivity estimates from Geoffroy et al (2013) and Forster et al (2013).

Because the CMIP5 data files are very large they are not included in this folder.
